# WindowsProductivity
My list of productivity tools, Browser extensions, and other must-have tools.

# Programs

[Winsplit Revolution - no longer maintained](https://winsplit-revolution.en.softonic.com/) - A Must-have for positioning windows. The below AHK script has Winsplit as a dependency. 


[Ninite](https://ninite.com/) for quickly installing programs, such as: VLC, Zoom Discord, Spotify, Dropbox, ImgBurn, 7-Zip, Python, Notepad++, Putty (though I prefer Kitty), WinSCP, Greenshot, Launchy (though I prefer listary), Chrome, Firefox.  

 instead of Ninite, also consider [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), which has most of the belowprograms.  At some point in the future, I'll write a script to auto-install the below tools. 
 
 
[Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) - for creating custom keyboard shortcuts and text expansions.

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - the best free password manager.

[uMatrix](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf?hl=en) - Extension for blocking pesky videos, javascript, cross-site requests, frames, etc. in web pages.

[ublock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) - Another extension for blocking popups and ads. 

[Alt-Tab Terminator - $10, but well worth](https://www.ntwind.com/software/alttabter.html) - To quickly find a window based on its name.  It's very useful when you've got 100 Windows Open, and need to quickly find the one window you're looking for. 

If you don't want to spend $$ on ATT, you could alternatively use [Switcheroo](https://github.com/kvakulo/Switcheroo)

[Ditto](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ditto-cp/) - clipboard manager.  Allows you to quickly search and re-use previously-copied text/images, etc.  I'm considering [ClipClip](https://clipclip.com/) as a potential improved replacement.

[Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) - The best screenshot-taking utility that I've come across.  I do wish that it had better support for high-dpi monitors.

[Listary](https://www.listary.com/) - Useful for quickly finding files, running applications, jumping to folders, etc.

[Motion](https://www.inmotion.app/) - Browser extension for reducing distractions.

# Autohotkey Scripts
