# WindowsProductivity
My list of productivity tools, Browser extensions, and other must-have tools.

[Ninite](https://ninite.com/) for quickly installing programs, such as: VLC, Zoom Discord, Spotify, Dropbox, ImgBurn, 7-Zip, Python, Notepad++, Putty (though I prefer Kitty), WinSCP, Greenshot, Launchy (though I prefer listary), Chrome, Firefox.  

 instead of Ninite, also consider [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), which has most of the belowprograms.  At some point in the future, I'll write a script to auto-install the below tools. 
 
 
[Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) - for creating custom keyboard shortcuts and text expansions.

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - the best free password manager.

[uMatrix](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf?hl=en) - Extension for blocking pesky videos, javascript, cross-site requests, frames, etc. in web pages.

[ublock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) - Anotehr extension for blockiong popups and ads. 

[Alt-Tab Terminator - $10, but well worth](https://www.ntwind.com/software/alttabter.html) - To quickly find a window based on its name.  It's very useful when you've got 100 Windows Open, and need to quickly find the one window you're looking for. 

If you don't want to spend $$ on ATT, you could alternatively use [Switcheroo](https://github.com/kvakulo/Switcheroo)

[Ditto](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ditto-cp/) - clipboard manager.  Allows you to quickly search and re-use previously-copied text/images, etc.

[Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) - The best screenshot-taking utility that I've come across.  I do wish that it had better support for high-dpi monitors.

[Listary](https://www.listary.com/) - Useful for quickly finding files, running applications, jumping to folders, etc.

[Winsplit Revolution - no longer maintained](https://winsplit-revolution.en.softonic.com/) - A Must-have for positioning windows. 

Autohotkey Scripts 
 - Patents.ahk - this is my day-to-day 


Customizations for Word 
  
  I use the following shortcut keys: 
    ctrl+shift+s: strikethrough 
    f3: toggle the navigation pane 
  

Visio Registry Hack - Forces each Visio document to open in a separate window
